          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>Vignan's Institute of Information Technology (VIIT) was established in 2002 in the City of Destiny,
            Visakhapatnam, to cater to the educational needs of the general public.</p>
            <p> It acquired Autonomous status in the year 2017 and NBA and NAAC(A+) accredited Institute.</p>
          <p>At Vignan's Institute of Information Technology, we believe that everyone deserves access to high-quality education. Our mission is to provide educational opportunities to underserved communities around the world.</p>
          <p>What sets us apart is our commitment to innovation. We believe that technology can play a powerful role in expanding access to education, so we invest heavily in digital learning tools and platforms.</p>
          <p>But we also know that technology is only part of the solution. That's why we work closely with local partners to ensure that our programs are tailored to the unique needs and cultural contexts of the communities we serve.</p>
          <p>We're proud of the impact we've made so far. In the past year alone, we've reached over 10,000 students across three continents. And we're just getting started.</p>
